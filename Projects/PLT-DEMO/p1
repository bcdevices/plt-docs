Using `identPrefix:` :

Want a more compact test plan ? You can use `identPrefix:` to avoid having
to specify `ident:` for every test item.

So instead of:

```
title: "ICT Demo Test Plan V1.3"
suite:
- ident: ICT-T0
  title: Power up
  steps:
  - command: power SWD on
  - command: sleepms 1000
- ident: ICT-T1
  title: Identify DUT
  steps:
  - command: identify nRF52
  - command: sleepms 1000
```

you can now write:

```
title: "ICT Demo Test Plan V1.3"
identPrefix: "ICT-T"
suite:
- steps:
  - command: power SWD on
  - command: sleepms 1000
- steps:
  - command: identify nRF52
  - command: sleepms 1000
```

And the PLT will use the item identifiers "ICT-T0", "ICT-T1", ....

(`title:` is optional for test items, so I've also ommitted that in this example)

Explicitly specfying an `ident:` field for a test item may still be useful,
to map a test item to an identifier in a high-level test plan (assuming the customer
has one)
